The main theme of our project is to help the deprived people. Existing authorization mechanisms failed to provide powerful and robust tools for handling security at the scale necessary for today’s Internet. Funds management is the management of the cash flow of a financial institution.  The Fund-management approach is a block chain technology developed as an answer to the inadequacy of traditional authorization mechanisms. The distributed ledger technology underlying bitcoin, may prove to be far more valuable than the currency it supports. But it’s only as valuable as it is secure. Further advantages of the trust-management approach include proofs that requested transactions comply with local policies and system architectures that encourage developers and administrators to consider an application’s security policy carefully and specify it explicitly. In this project we are introducing the concept of sharing funds among various trust committees. Here, various trusts are connected through distributed system and every trust has the capability to make use of money but to a certain limit. These trusts can also communicate to each other when any of the trusts in the chain requires funds then the other trusts can transfer money this is possible through block chain.
